# looprig/host

`host` is Looprig's Department runtime host. A Host is a tenant-scoped process
that keeps runtime targets resident, consumes commands addressed to it, serves
the HostLink realtime surface, and drains on release.

Host is **consumed by** Factory. It imports no Factory package, no web or
terminal UI, and no product repository. That boundary is enforced by
[`import_boundary_test.go`](import_boundary_test.go), which parses the import
declarations of every Go file the module owns rather than searching source
text, and fails loudly if it walked nothing.

Centrifuge is permitted in exactly one directory,
`internal/realtime/hostlink/`, and the scope is derived from a single constant
and compared segment by segment, so a sibling package under
`internal/realtime/` does not inherit it.

## Status

Scaffold. The exported surface is a placeholder `Host` carrying its identity.
Department, residency, command consumption, HostLink and drain follow.

## Build and test
